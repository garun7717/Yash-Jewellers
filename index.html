        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Pleasing, graceful, classic, shapely, heirloom-quality, handsome, lustrous –These are an excellent choice for vintage-inspired jewelry and simple, traditional designs because they suggest a slightly vintage, candlelit glamour. Someone who wanted, for instance, classic and traditional wedding jewelry with the “Grandma’s pearls” look would be attracted to jewelry that was accurately described this way. Intriguing, alluring, fascinating, enthralling, tantalizing,
            compelling –These words connote equal parts romance and mystery. They suggest an engaging or even hypnotic effect. They might be particularly appropriate for found-object jewelry, steampunk jewelry, particularly unusual materials or techniques like chainmaille where the structural complexity is important to the appeal.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Delightful, darling, sparkling, delicious, charming, precious –Superb for jewelry that’s either intended for younger women and girls or uses a feminine “cuteness” for its appeal. Consider these for more delicate designs, charm bracelets and necklaces, miniatures of bigger items, or colorful polymer clay, because the connotation of these choices is all about sweetness and fun. Splendid, exquisite, magnificent, luxurious, queenly, divine –Perfect diction when you’re selling wedding jewelry or pieces made with very fine materials, directing your customer’s attention to the quality you’ve put into every step. It makes your pieces sound worthy to be crown jewels, perfect for your top-dollar pieces and for advertising custom special-occasion work.
